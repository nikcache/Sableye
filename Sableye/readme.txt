Sableye is a program which can be used on a windows computer to control/automate workflows
with the help of gesture control. There are four components to this repository:
    - - MeanLook
        - - Visual Data Extraction
    - - Detect
        - - Pattern Matching Gesture Recognition
    - - NastyPlot
        - - Automation scripts
    - - FoulPlay
        - - Error handling and E2E Testing

I'm making this project opensource as I think this could be a useful and popular tool if
built correctly. I'm also open to others opening PRs with issues too :) My aim with this
project is to make my own workflows more efficient so I can be more productive 

TL;DR - I'm lazy, computer do things for me
